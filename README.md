Intelligence Analyst | Event Producer Turned Data Storyteller | Strategic Thinker with a Creative Edge

Iâ€™m a Business Intelligence Analyst who thrives at the intersection of data, operations, and storytelling. With a background in event production and program coordination, Iâ€™ve built businesses, led teams, and delivered unforgettable experiencesâ€”all while developing the analytical mindset and hustle it takes to solve real-world problems with data.

Armed with SQL, Excel, and Tableau, I turn messy datasets into clean insights that spark action. Whether itâ€™s uncovering customer trends through cohort analysis, tracking retention, or mapping out performance metrics, I love connecting the dots and translating complexity into clarity.

By day, Iâ€™m diving into dashboards and solving business puzzles. By night (and weekend), I run a Bay Area event production companyâ€”juggling client needs, logistics, budgets, and live experiences. That real-time pressure taught me how to adapt fast, communicate clearly, and think five steps ahead.

Iâ€™m ready to bring my data brain and creative heart to a forward-thinking team where insights matter. If you're working on bold ideas powered by dataâ€”Iâ€™d love to be part of it.
